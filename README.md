# Recipe-Book-App

## Project Description:

Create a web application that allows users to view and save recipes. Users should be able to browse through different recipes, search for specific recipes, and save their favorite recipes to a personal recipe book.

## Project Requirements:

1. Home Page - The home page should have a search bar where users can search for recipes. The page should also display a list of popular recipes.

2. Recipe Page - The recipe page should display the recipe's title, image, ingredients, and instructions. It should also have a button to save the recipe to the user's personal recipe book.

3. Personal Recipe Book - The personal recipe book should display all the recipes that the user has saved. The user should be able to view, edit, and delete their saved recipes.

4. Testing with Jest - Use Jest to write unit tests for your JavaScript code.

5. Responsive Design - The application should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. Styling - Use CSS to style the application and make it visually appealing.

7. Accessibility - Ensure that the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Bonus Features:

1. User Authentication - Implement user authentication to allow users to sign up and log in to their personal recipe book.

2. Recipe Sharing - Allow users to share recipes on social media platforms.

3. Recipe Categories - Categorize recipes by type of cuisine or meal.

4. Recipe Rating - Allow users to rate recipes and display the average rating for each recipe.

5. Shopping List - Allow users to create a shopping list for the ingredients they need to buy for their saved recipes.

By the end of this project, you'll have a fully functional web application that demonstrates your skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Jest testing.
